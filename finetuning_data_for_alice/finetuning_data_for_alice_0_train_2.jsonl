If `dp[i]` is not `-1`, it means that length `i` can be achieved, and it attempts to extend that length by adding `a`, `b`, or `c`.\n\n3. **Updating dp Array**: For each possible segment length addition (either `a`, `b`, or `c`), it checks if the new length is within bounds (i.e., `<= n`). If it is, it updates `dp` at that index to be the maximum of the current value or the value at `dp[i] + 1`, indicating that one more segment has been added.\n\n4. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns `dp[n]`, which represents the maximum number of segments that can be formed to achieve the length `n`.\n\nTo create a semantically different program, we can alter the logic of the loop or the conditions under which the `dp` array is updated. For instance, we could change the condition for updating `dp` so that it only updates if the current number of segments is less than the value being calculated, which would prevent the maximum segments from being accurately calculated.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef maximum_segments(n, a, b, c) : \n\tdp = [-1] * (n + 10) \n\tdp[0] = 0\n\tfor i in range(0, n) : \n\t\tif (dp[i] != -1) : \n\t\t\tif(i + a <= n ): \n\t\t\t\tif dp[i + a] == -1 or dp[i + a] > dp[i] + 1:\n\t\t\t\t\tdp[i + a] = dp[i] + 1 \n\t\t\tif(i + b <= n ): \n\t\t\t\tif dp[i + b] == -1 or dp[i + b] > dp[i] + 1:\n\t\t\t\t\tdp[i + b] = dp[i] + 1 \n\t\t\tif(i + c <= n ): \n\t\t\t\tif dp[i + c] == -1 or dp[i + c] > dp[i] + 1:\n\t\t\t\t\tdp[i + c] = dp[i] + 1 \n\treturn dp[n]\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"n\": 7,\n  \"a\": 5,\n  \"b\": 2,\n  \"c\": 3\n}\n```"}]}

The function follows these steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**: It initializes an empty list called `ludics`.\n2. **Populating the List**: It fills the `ludics` list with integers from 1 to `n`.\n3. **Removing Elements**: It enters a loop that removes elements from the `ludics` list based on the value of the current element. The removal is done in a nested loop where the outer loop iterates through the `ludics` list, and the inner loop removes elements at specific indices calculated using the current element's value.\n4. **Return**: Finally, it returns the modified list of ludic numbers.\n\nTo create a semantically different program, we can modify the logic of the inner loop that removes elements.

This change will lead to incorrect calculations for certain inputs, particularly when `n` is greater than 1.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef bell_Number(n): \n    bell = [[0 for i in range(n+1)] for j in range(n+1)] \n    bell[0][0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]\n        for j in range(1, i):  # Changed from `range(1, i+1)` to `range(1, i)`\n            bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1] \n    return bell[n][0] \n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"n\": 2\n}\n```"}]}

This will ensure that the function behaves differently under certain inputs.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef get_inv_count(arr, n): \n\tinv_count = 0\n\tfor i in range(n): \n\t\tfor j in range(i + 1, n): \n\t\t\tif (arr[i] >= arr[j]):  # Change the condition to count more pairs\n\t\t\t\tinv_count += 1\n\t\t\tif inv_count > 5:  # Introduce an arbitrary cutoff to alter behavior\n\t\t\t\treturn inv_count\n\treturn inv_count \n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"arr\": [5, 3, 4, 2, 1],\n  \"n\": 5\n}\n```"}]}

The reason this is non-semantically equivalent is that while both functions are still summing the powers of odd numbers, they will yield completely different outputs for any `n > 0`.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef odd_Num_Sum(n) : \n    j = 0\n    sm = 0\n    for i in range(1,n + 1) : \n        j = (2*i-1) \n        sm = sm + (j*j*j)   # Changed exponent from 4 to 3\n    return sm \n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"n\": 5\n}\n```"}]}

A balanced string is one where every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.\n\nLet's break down the key points of the original code:\n\n1. **Odd Length Check**: If the length of the expression is odd, it immediately returns `False`, as it's impossible to have a balanced set of brackets.\n\n2. **Using a Stack**: The program uses a deque as a stack to keep track of opening brackets. When it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack.\n\n3. **Closing Bracket Validation**: For every closing bracket encountered, it checks if the stack is empty (which would indicate an unmatched closing bracket). If not empty, it pops the top of the stack and checks if the popped bracket matches the type of the closing bracket.\n\n4. **Final Check**: At the end of the loop, if the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets had matching closing brackets; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n### Points of Modification\nTo create a semantically different program, I can introduce a change that modifies the logic of checking bracket matching. For instance, I could introduce a scenario where the program mistakenly assumes a certain type of bracket can match with another type.

This will ensure that the behavior of the new program diverges from the original under certain inputs.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef count_reverse_pairs(test_list):\n    res = sum([1 for idx in range(0, len(test_list)) \n                for idxn in range(idx + 1, len(test_list)) \n                if test_list[idxn] == str(''.join(list(reversed(test_list[idx])))) and idx % 2 == 0])\n    return str(res)\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"test_list\": [\"abc\", \"cba\", \"abc\", \"xyz\", \"zyx\"]\n}\n```", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Predict the difficulty level of the instance.

It takes two lists, `arr` and `dep`, which represent the arrival and departure times of trains, respectively, and an integer `n` that indicates the number of trains.\n\n### Step-by-step breakdown:\n1. **Sorting**: The arrival and departure lists are sorted. This is crucial because we need to process the events in chronological order.\n2. **Initialization**: Two counters, `plat_needed` and `result`, are initialized to track the current number of platforms needed and the maximum number encountered, respectively.\n3. **Two-pointer technique**: Two indices, `i` and `j`, are used to traverse the arrival and departure arrays.\n   - If the next train arrives before or when the current train departs (`arr[i] <= dep[j]`), we need an additional platform.\n   - If the next train departs before the next train arrives (`arr[i] > dep[j]`), we can reduce the number of platforms needed.\n4. **Updating result**: After each comparison, if the current `plat_needed` exceeds `result`, we update `result`.\n5. **Return**: Finally, the function returns the maximum number of platforms needed.\n\n### Modification for Diverging Behavior\nTo create a semantically different program, we can alter the sorting mechanism. Instead of sorting the arrival and departure times, we could introduce a mechanism that processes the lists in their original order or in a different, potentially erroneous order.

It returns the length of the subarray that has the maximum sum. \n\n### Key Variables:\n- `max_so_far`: This variable holds the maximum sum found so far.\n- `max_ending_here`: This variable keeps track of the sum of the current subarray being evaluated.\n- `start`, `end`: These variables are used to track the indices of the subarray with the maximum sum.\n- `s`: This variable is used to mark the starting index of the current subarray.\n\n### Flow of Execution:\n1. The function initializes `max_so_far` to the smallest possible integer value and `max_ending_here` to 0.\n2. It iterates through the array `a` and updates `max_ending_here` with the current element.\n3. If `max_ending_here` exceeds `max_so_far`, it updates `max_so_far` and the indices `start` and `end`.\n4. If `max_ending_here` becomes negative, it resets `max_ending_here` to 0 and updates `s` to the next index.\n5. Finally, it returns the length of the subarray that produced the maximum sum, calculated as `(end - start + 1)`.\n\n### Modifications for Divergence:\nTo create a semantically different program, we can change the way we handle negative sums. Instead of resetting `max_ending_here` to 0 when it becomes negative, we could allow it to continue accumulating but keep track of the maximum length of contiguous subarrays found.

If a model does not have a `'color'` key, we can either raise an exception or handle it differently (e.g., treating it as having a default color).\n\nBy doing this, we can ensure that there are inputs that will cause the two functions to behave differently.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef sorted_models(models):\n    def sort_key(model):\n        if 'special' in model and model['special']:\n            return (0, model['color'])  # Prioritize special models\n        return (1, model.get('color', ''))  # Default to empty string if 'color' is missing\n\n    sorted_models = sorted(models, key=sort_key)\n    return sorted_models\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"models\": [\n    {\"color\": \"red\", \"special\": True},\n    {\"color\": \"blue\"},\n    {\"special\": True},\n    {\"color\": \"green\"}\n  ]\n}\n```", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Predict the difficulty level of the instance.

A chain can be formed by selecting pairs such that the first element of a pair is greater than the second element of the previous pair in the chain.\n\n### Key Components\n1. **Class Definition**: The `Pair` class holds two attributes `a` and `b`.\n2. **Function Logic**:\n   - It initializes a list `mcl` where each index represents the maximum chain length ending at that index, initialized to 1 (each pair can be a chain of length 1 by itself).\n   - It uses two nested loops to check each pair of pairs to see if they can form a chain based on the conditions specified.\n   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the `mcl` list.\n\n### Diverging Behavior\nTo create a non-semantic equivalent program, we can modify the logic of how the pairs are evaluated for forming chains. For instance, we could introduce a condition that always allows the chain to continue regardless of the pair values. This will result in a program that always returns the length of the input list, which diverges from the original behavior that returns the maximum chain length based on the defined conditions.\n\n### Changes to Implement\n1.

Start by carefully analyzing the original program and think of how an example would propagate through it from the input to the return value, considering how to modify the program in order to elicit a different behavior. Make sure that the return values or exceptions raised by your program are picklable.\nThe original program and your program will be used in a test to evaluate the skill of an expert computer scientist who will have to produce a diverging example (not necessarily the same as yours), so make sure that the difference you introduce are not very easy to understand. You will be given a difficulty level from 0 (easiest) to 10 (hardest) to target. E.g. difficulty level 0 means that an expert computer scientist in the bottom decile or above should be able to find a diverging example, difficulty level 9 means that only an expert computer scientist in the top decile should be able to find a diverging example, and difficulty level 10 means that only the top 1% or less of expert computer scientists should be able to find a diverging example.\nThink step by step before writing your program.

One subtle change could be to incorrectly match the brackets or to skip certain checks altogether.\n\nFor example, we could modify the program to:\n- Always return `True` if the first character is a closing bracket, which would incorrectly allow for unbalanced expressions to pass as valid.\n\nThis modification will create cases where the two programs will yield different results, particularly when the input starts with a closing bracket.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\ndef check_expression(exp):\n    if len(exp) & 1:\n        return False\n    stack = deque()\n    if exp and exp[0] in {')', '}', ']'}:  # Introduced faulty check\n        return True  # Incorrectly allows unbalanced expressions\n    for ch in exp:\n        if ch == '(' or ch == '{' or ch == '[':\n            stack.append(ch)\n        if ch == ')' or ch == '}' or ch == ']':\n            if not stack:\n                return False\n            top = stack.pop()\n            if (top == '(' and ch != ')') or (top == '{' and ch != '}') or (top == '[' and ch != ']'):\n                return False\n    return not stack\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"exp\": \")([]{}\"\n}\n```", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Predict the difficulty level of the instance.

Start by carefully analyzing the original program and think of how an example would propagate through it from the input to the return value, considering how to modify the program in order to elicit a different behavior. Make sure that the return values or exceptions raised by your program are picklable.\nThe original program and your program will be used in a test to evaluate the skill of an expert computer scientist who will have to produce a diverging example (not necessarily the same as yours), so make sure that the difference you introduce are not very easy to understand. You will be given a difficulty level from 0 (easiest) to 10 (hardest) to target. E.g. difficulty level 0 means that an expert computer scientist in the bottom decile or above should be able to find a diverging example, difficulty level 9 means that only an expert computer scientist in the top decile should be able to find a diverging example, and difficulty level 10 means that only the top 1% or less of expert computer scientists should be able to find a diverging example.\nThink step by step before writing your program.

The original function would return `False` if `check_list` is empty, while the new function should return `True` for an empty `check_list` since all elements (none) are trivially found.\n\nWith these changes, the program will diverge in behavior from the original.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef check_element(test_tup, check_list):\n    if not check_list:\n        return True\n    res = True\n    for ele in check_list:\n        if ele not in test_tup:\n            res = False\n            break\n    return res\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"test_tup\": (1, 2, 3),\n  \"check_list\": [2, 4]\n}\n```", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Predict the difficulty level of the instance.

The goal is to minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the selected elements from each array. The function uses a three-pointer approach to traverse through the arrays simultaneously.\n\n## Key Points of the Original Program\n1. **Initialization**: It initializes `diff` to the maximum possible integer size, and indices `res_i`, `res_j`, and `res_k` to store the best found indices.\n2. **While Loop**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in all three arrays.\n3. **Finding Minimum and Maximum**: For each iteration, it finds the minimum and maximum values among the current pointed elements of `A`, `B`, and `C`.\n4. **Updating Results**: If the difference between the maximum and minimum is smaller than the previously found difference, it updates the result indices.\n5. **Pointer Movement**: It increments the pointer of the array that contains the current minimum value, effectively trying to find a closer range in the next iterations.\n6. **Termination Condition**: The loop can terminate early if a perfect match (difference of 0) is found.\n\n## Modifications for Divergence\nTo create a semantically different program, I will change the logic of pointer movement. Instead of always moving the pointer of the array with the current minimum, I will introduce a condition that randomly decides to move a pointer of one of the arrays based on their current values. This could lead to scenarios where the function does not find the closest values efficiently, potentially causing it to run indefinitely or return suboptimal results.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\nimport sys \nimport random\n\ndef find_closet(A, B, C, p, q, r): \n\tdiff = sys.maxsize \n\tres_i = 0\n\tres_j = 0\n\tres_k = 0\n\ti = 0\n\tj = 0\n\tk = 0\n\twhile(i < p and j < q and k < r): \n\t\tminimum = min(A[i], min(B[j], C[k])) \n\t\tmaximum = max(A[i], max(B[j], C[k])) \n\t\tif maximum - minimum < diff: \n\t\t\tres_i = i \n\t\t\tres_j = j \n\t\t\tres_k = k \n\t\t\tdiff = maximum - minimum \n\t\tif diff == 0: \n\t\t\tbreak\n\t\t# Randomly decide to move a pointer\n\t\tmove_pointer = random.choice(['A', 'B', 'C'])\n\t\tif move_pointer == 'A':\n\t\t\ti += 1\n\t\telif move_pointer == 'B':\n\t\t\tj += 1\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\tk += 1\n\treturn A[res_i], B[res_j], C[res_k]\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"A\": [1, 4, 10],\n  \"B\": [2, 15, 20],\n  \"C\": [10, 12, 30],\n  \"p\": 3,\n  \"q\": 3,\n  \"r\": 3\n}\n```", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Predict the difficulty level of the instance.

If it does not match, it returns `False`.\n\n4. **Final Check**: At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, it returns `True` (indicating a balanced expression); otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nTo create a semantically different program, we can introduce an error in the closing bracket matching logic, specifically by allowing certain unmatched closing brackets to pass through, thereby causing it to return `True` incorrectly for some inputs.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\ndef check_expression(exp):\n    if len(exp) & 1:\n        return False\n    stack = deque()\n    for ch in exp:\n        if ch == '(' or ch == '{' or ch == '[':\n            stack.append(ch)\n        if ch == ')' or ch == '}' or ch == ']':\n            if not stack:\n                return False\n            top = stack.pop()\n            # Introduce a logic error: allowing mismatched brackets\n            if (top == '(' and ch != ')') or (top == '{' and ch != '}') or (top == '[' and ch != ']'):\n                continue  # Instead of returning False, we continue\n    return not stack\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"exp\": \"{[()]}[}\"\n}\n```", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Predict the difficulty level of the instance.

Then, an inner loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, checking if the current element is equal to the next one. If they are equal, it increments `count`. If they are not, it breaks out of the inner loop.\n\n6. **Updating Result**: After the inner loop, the maximum value between `res` and `count` is assigned to `res`.

One subtle change could be to alter the coefficients in the recurrence relation or change the base cases, which would lead to a completely different output for certain inputs.\n\n### Potential Changes\n1. **Change the recurrence relation**: Instead of `dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 2 * dp[i - 2]`, we could use a different coefficient or a different formula entirely.\n2. **Change base cases**: Modifying the base cases will also lead to different results.\n\n### Chosen Modification\nFor the modified version, I will change the recurrence relation to:\n- `dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]` (removing the multiplication by 2).\n\nThis change will create a divergence in the output for inputs greater than 1, as the Jacobsthal sequence grows differently than the modified sequence.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef jacobsthal_num(n): \n\tdp = [0] * (n + 1) \n\tdp[0] = 0\n\tdp[1] = 1\n\tfor i in range(2, n + 1): \n\t\tdp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]  # Changed coefficient from 2 to 1\n\treturn dp[n]\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"n\": 5\n}\n```", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Predict the difficulty level of the instance.

It filters this list to keep only those strings that start with an uppercase letter followed by all lowercase letters. After filtering, it concatenates the remaining strings and returns the length of the resulting string.\n\n### Step-by-step Breakdown:\n1. **Input:** A list of sample names (strings).\n2. **Filtering:**\n   - The filtering is done using a lambda function that checks:\n     - `el[0].isupper()`: The first character must be uppercase.\n     - `el[1:].islower()`: All characters after the first must be lowercase.\n3. **Join Operation:** The filtered list is concatenated into a single string.\n4. **Return Value:** The function returns the length of this concatenated string.\n\n### Potential Changes:\nTo create a semantically different program, I can alter the filtering criteria in such a way that it will not only change which names are included but could also lead to an exception or different output based on the input. For example, I could introduce a requirement that checks if the length of the name is even, which will exclude names that don't meet this condition. This would change the output for a set of inputs.\n\nAdditionally, I could introduce a bug by trying to access an index that might not exist in certain cases, leading to an `IndexError`.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef sample_nam(sample_names):\n    sample_names = list(filter(lambda el: len(el) > 1 and el[0].isupper() and el[1].islower() and len(el) % 2 == 0, sample_names))\n    if not sample_names:\n        return -1  # Return -1 if no names passed the filter\n    return len(''.join(sample_names[0]))  # Return length of the first filtered name\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"sample_names\": [\"Alice\", \"BOB\", \"charlie\", \"David\", \"Eve\"]\n}\n```", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Predict the difficulty level of the instance.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert computer scientist. Your task is to take a Python 3.10 program and write a similar program which is not semantically equivalent, which means that there must exist at least a diverging input example such that the original program and your program either produce different outputs or exceptions, or one halts and the other one does not halt. In addition to a program, you need to produce a diverging input example. Start by carefully analyzing the original program and think of how an example would propagate through it from the input to the return value, considering how to modify the program in order to elicit a different behavior. Make sure that the return values or exceptions raised by your program are picklable.\nThe original program and your program will be used in a test to evaluate the skill of an expert computer scientist who will have to produce a diverging example (not necessarily the same as yours), so make sure that the difference you introduce are not very easy to understand. You will be given a difficulty level from 0 (easiest) to 10 (hardest) to target. E.g. difficulty level 0 means that an expert computer scientist in the bottom decile or above should be able to find a diverging example, difficulty level 9 means that only an expert computer scientist in the top decile should be able to find a diverging example, and difficulty level 10 means that only the top 1% or less of expert computer scientists should be able to find a diverging example.\nThink step by step before writing your program.

If it is, the function returns 'accepted'; otherwise, it returns 'not accepted'.\n\nTo create a semantically different program, I will modify the logic of how the vowels are counted or introduce additional conditions that change the output based on the input. \n\nOne approach could be to check for a different number of unique characters instead of just vowels, or to introduce a condition that could cause the program to behave differently based on certain input characteristics. For example, I could introduce a condition that checks for the presence of a specific character or a substring, and if that condition is met, it would alter the counting of vowels or the final output.\n\nAnother possibility is to change the function to return a numeric value based on the number of unique vowels, which would also diverge from the original output type.\n\n## Changes to introduce:\n1. Instead of checking for vowels, I will check for consonants.\n2. I will change the condition to return a different message if the input string contains a specific character, say 'X'.\n3.
