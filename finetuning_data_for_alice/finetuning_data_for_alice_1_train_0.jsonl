Instead of checking if `arr[i] <= dep[j]`, we could check if `arr[i] < dep[j]`, which would change the behavior when a train arrives exactly when another departs.\n\nThis change will lead to a situation where the program may underestimate the number of platforms needed when trains arrive and depart at the same time.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef find_platform(arr, dep, n): \n    arr.sort() \n    dep.sort() \n    plat_needed = 1\n    result = 1\n    i = 1\n    j = 0\n    while (i < n and j < n): \n        if (arr[i] < dep[j]):  # Changed from <= to < \n            plat_needed += 1\n            i += 1\n        elif (arr[i] >= dep[j]):  # Changed from > to >=\n            plat_needed -= 1\n            j += 1\n        if (plat_needed > result):  \n            result = plat_needed           \n    return result\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"arr\": [10, 10, 10],\n  \"dep\": [10, 10, 10],\n  \"n\": 3\n}\n```"}]}

For each integer `i` in this range:\n   - It checks if `i` is a divisor of `n` (i.e., `n % i == 0`).\n   - If `i` is a divisor, it checks if `i` is equal to `n // i` (to handle perfect squares) and updates the count accordingly.\n3. **Determine even or odd**: After counting the divisors, it checks if the count is even or odd and returns the corresponding string.\n\nTo create a semantically different program, we can modify the divisor counting logic. One way to do this is to change the range of the loop or the conditions under which the count is updated. For example, we could skip counting certain divisors or alter the logic for determining even or odd.\n\n### Changes to Introduce\n- Modify the loop to start from 2 instead of 1, which will skip counting 1 as a divisor.\n- Change the condition for updating the count to only count divisors that are even, which will lead to incorrect results for most integers.\n- Introduce a logic that will always return \"Odd\" for certain inputs, creating a divergence.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\nimport math \ndef count_Divisors(n) : \n    count = 0\n    for i in range(2, (int)(math.sqrt(n)) + 2) : \n        if (n % i == 0) : \n            if( n // i == i and i % 2 == 0) : \n                count = count + 1\n            elif i % 2 == 0: \n                count = count + 2\n    if (count % 2 == 0) : \n        return (\"Odd\") \n    else : \n        return (\"Even\") \n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"n\": 12\n}\n```"}]}

A chain can be formed by selecting pairs such that the first element of a pair is greater than the second element of the previous pair in the chain.\n\n### Key Components\n1. **Class Definition**: The `Pair` class holds two attributes, `a` and `b`.\n2. **Function Logic**:\n   - It initializes a list `mcl` where `mcl[i]` represents the maximum chain length ending with the `i-th` pair.\n   - It uses two nested loops to fill the `mcl` list based on the chain conditions.\n   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the `mcl` list.\n\n### Diverging Behavior\nTo create a non-semantic equivalent program, we can introduce a modification that changes how the pairs are evaluated for forming chains. For instance, we could change the condition for forming a chain by allowing pairs to be selected based on a different criterion, such as the sum of `a` and `b` instead of just comparing `a` and `b`. This will lead to different chain lengths being calculated for the same input.\n\n### Modifications\n1. Change the chain formation condition to allow a pair to be added to the chain if the sum of its elements is greater than the sum of the elements of the previous pair in the chain.\n2. This will ensure that the logic diverges significantly from the original implementation.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\nclass Pair(object): \n    def __init__(self, a, b): \n        self.a = a \n        self.b = b \n\ndef max_chain_length(arr, n): \n    max = 0\n    mcl = [1 for i in range(n)] \n    for i in range(1, n): \n        for j in range(0, i): \n            if (arr[i].a + arr[i].b > arr[j].a + arr[j].b and\n                mcl[i] < mcl[j] + 1): \n                mcl[i] = mcl[j] + 1\n    for i in range(n): \n        if (max < mcl[i]): \n            max = mcl[i] \n    return max\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"arr\": [Pair(1, 2), Pair(2, 3), Pair(3, 4)],\n  \"n\": 3\n}\n```"}]}

Start by carefully analyzing the original program and think of how an example would propagate through it from the input to the return value, considering how to modify the program in order to elicit a different behavior. Make sure that the return values or exceptions raised by your program are picklable.\nThe original program and your program will be used in a test to evaluate the skill of an expert computer scientist who will have to produce a diverging example (not necessarily the same as yours), so make sure that the difference you introduce are not very easy to understand. You will be given a difficulty level from 0 (easiest) to 10 (hardest) to target. E.g. difficulty level 0 means that an expert computer scientist in the bottom decile or above should be able to find a diverging example, difficulty level 9 means that only an expert computer scientist in the top decile should be able to find a diverging example, and difficulty level 10 means that only the top 1% or less of expert computer scientists should be able to find a diverging example.\nThink step by step before writing your program.

This will raise an `IndexError` if any sublist is empty.\n3. **Output**: The output is a new list composed of the last elements of each sublist in the order they appear in `lst`.\n\nTo create a semantically different program, we can introduce behavior that changes how we handle the sublists. For example, we could return the first element instead of the last, or we could introduce a condition that alters the output based on the content of the sublists.\n\n### Diverging Behavior\n- If we modify the program to return the first element of each sublist instead of the last, it will produce different outputs for any input where the length of the sublists varies.\n- If we introduce a condition that checks for the length of the sublist and handles empty sublists differently, it can lead to different exceptions or outputs compared to the original program.\n\n### Modifications\n1.

The helper function `set_middle_bits` modifies the bits of `n` by shifting them and applying bitwise OR operations, effectively setting the middle bits of `n` to 1 and then returning a modified version of `n`. The main function toggles the bits of `n` based on the result of `set_middle_bits`.\n\n### Key Observations\n1. **Bit Manipulation**: The `set_middle_bits` function works by manipulating the bits of `n` through a series of shifts and OR operations.

Start by carefully analyzing the original program and think of how an example would propagate through it from the input to the return value, considering how to modify the program in order to elicit a different behavior. Make sure that the return values or exceptions raised by your program are picklable.\nThe original program and your program will be used in a test to evaluate the skill of an expert computer scientist who will have to produce a diverging example (not necessarily the same as yours), so make sure that the difference you introduce are not very easy to understand.

A reverse pair consists of two strings where one is the reverse of the other. The function does this by iterating through each string in the list, reversing it, and then checking how many times this reversed string appears later in the list.\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Nested Loops**: The function uses two nested loops. The outer loop iterates through each index `idx` of the list, and the inner loop iterates from `idx` to the end of the list.\n2. **String Reversal**: For each string at index `idx`, it reverses the string and checks for its occurrence in the subsequent elements of the list.\n3. **Counting**: It counts occurrences and sums them up to get the final result.\n4. **Return Type**: The result is returned as a string.\n\n### Potential Modifications:\nTo create a semantically different program, we can alter the logic in such a way that it does not count reverse pairs correctly.

However, we can also introduce a flaw by altering the way we collect indices or by changing the comparison logic to be less strict, such as allowing for some characters to map to the same index.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef is_Isomorphic(str1, str2):\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        return False\n    \n    dict_str1 = {}\n    dict_str2 = {}\n    for i, value in enumerate(str1):\n        dict_str1[value] = dict_str1.get(value, 0) + 1  # Count occurrences instead of collecting indices\n    for j, value in enumerate(str2):\n        dict_str2[value] = dict_str2.get(value, 0) + 1  # Count occurrences instead of collecting indices\n    \n    # Allowing for different counts to be considered isomorphic\n    if sorted(dict_str1.values()) == sorted(dict_str2.values()) or len(dict_str1) != len(dict_str2):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"str1\": \"abb\",\n  \"str2\": \"xyx\"\n}\n```"}]}

This will lead to a situation where the function may not find the optimal elements, and could potentially enter an infinite loop if the conditions are set up incorrectly.\n\n### Changes Made:\n- Introduced a random decision-making process for pointer adjustment.\n- This change can lead to different outputs or an infinite loop depending on the input arrays.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\nimport sys\nimport random\n\ndef find_closet(A, B, C, p, q, r): \n\tdiff = sys.maxsize \n\tres_i = 0\n\tres_j = 0\n\tres_k = 0\n\ti = 0\n\tj = 0\n\tk = 0\n\twhile(i < p and j < q and k < r): \n\t\tminimum = min(A[i], min(B[j], C[k])) \n\t\tmaximum = max(A[i], max(B[j], C[k])); \n\t\tif maximum - minimum < diff: \n\t\t\tres_i = i \n\t\t\tres_j = j \n\t\t\tres_k = k \n\t\t\tdiff = maximum - minimum; \n\t\tif diff == 0: \n\t\t\tbreak\n\t\t# Randomly decide to move one of the pointers\n\t\tmove_pointer = random.choice(['A', 'B', 'C'])\n\t\tif move_pointer == 'A':\n\t\t\ti += 1\n\t\telif move_pointer == 'B':\n\t\t\tj += 1\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\tk += 1\n\treturn A[res_i], B[res_j], C[res_k]\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"A\": [1, 4, 10],\n  \"B\": [2, 15, 20],\n  \"C\": [10, 12, 30],\n  \"p\": 3,\n  \"q\": 3,\n  \"r\": 3\n}\n```"}]}

This will ensure that the output can differ based on the input dictionaries, especially when they have overlapping keys.\n\n### Changes to Introduce\n- Instead of using `ChainMap`, we will iterate through the keys of both dictionaries and randomly select values for overlapping keys.\n- This introduces non-determinism in the output based on the random selection.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    merged_dict = {}\n    all_keys = set(dict1.keys()).union(set(dict2.keys()))\n    \n    for key in all_keys:\n        if key in dict1 and key in dict2:\n            # Randomly choose between dict1[key] and dict2[key]\n            merged_dict[key] = random.choice([dict1[key], dict2[key]])\n        elif key in dict1:\n            merged_dict[key] = dict1[key]\n        else:\n            merged_dict[key] = dict2[key]\n    \n    return merged_dict\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"dict1\": {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2},\n  \"dict2\": {\"b\": 3, \"c\": 4}\n}\n```"}]}

For instance, if we modify `b` to be `[6, 5, 2]`, the results will diverge.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef find_Min_Sum(a, b, n): \n    a.sort() \n    b.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort b in descending order\n    sum = 0  \n    for i in range(n): \n        sum = sum + abs(a[i] - b[i]) \n    return sum\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"a\": [1, 2, 3],\n  \"b\": [6, 5, 2],\n  \"n\": 3\n}\n```"}]}

Instead of counting set bits, we can introduce a condition that alters the counting behavior based on whether `n` is even or odd. This will ensure that for certain inputs, the two programs will produce different results.\n\n### Key Changes\n- Introduce a condition that changes the counting mechanism based on the parity of `n`.\n- This will lead to different outputs for odd and even values of `n`, which is a subtle change that can lead to divergence.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef count_Set_Bits(n) :  \n    n += 1; \n    powerOf2 = 2;   \n    cnt = n // 2;  \n    while (powerOf2 <= n) : \n        totalPairs = n // powerOf2;  \n        if n % 2 == 0:  # If n is even\n            cnt += (totalPairs // 2) * powerOf2;  \n        else:  # If n is odd\n            cnt += (totalPairs // 2) * powerOf2 + (n % powerOf2)\n        powerOf2 <<= 1;    \n    return cnt;  \n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"n\": 5\n}\n```"}]}

One way to do this is to change how we handle the counting of set bits when `totalPairs` is odd. Instead of adding `(n % powerOf2)`, we could subtract it or perform a different operation. This will lead to different results for certain inputs.\n\n### Example Diverging Input\nThe diverging input example will be a positive integer `n` where the difference in logic will cause the two functions to yield different results.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef count_Set_Bits(n) :  \n    n += 1; \n    powerOf2 = 2;   \n    cnt = n // 2;  \n    while (powerOf2 <= n) : \n        totalPairs = n // powerOf2;  \n        cnt += (totalPairs // 2) * powerOf2;  \n        if (totalPairs & 1) : \n            cnt -= (n % powerOf2)  # Changed from += to -=\n        else : \n            cnt += 0\n        powerOf2 <<= 1;    \n    return cnt;  \n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"n\": 5\n}\n```"}]}

Specifically, we can modify the conditions under which the program checks for matching brackets, allowing certain mismatches to go undetected. This will lead to cases where the program incorrectly identifies an unbalanced expression as balanced.\n\n### Potential Changes\n1. **Incorrect Matching Logic**: We can alter the matching logic so that it allows certain mismatches to pass through.\n2. **Stack Manipulation**: We can introduce a scenario where the stack is manipulated in a way that does not accurately reflect the state of unmatched brackets.\n\nBy making these changes, we can ensure that there are inputs that will cause the modified program to produce different outputs than the original.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\ndef check_expression(exp):\n    if len(exp) & 1:\n        return False\n    stack = deque()\n    for ch in exp:\n        if ch == '(' or ch == '{' or ch == '[':\n            stack.append(ch)\n        if ch == ')' or ch == '}' or ch == ']':\n            if not stack:\n                return False\n            top = stack.pop()\n            # Introduce incorrect matching logic\n            if (top == '(' and ch != ')') and (top != '{' and top != '['):\n                return False\n    return True  # Changed to return True even if stack is not empty\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"exp\": \"{[()]}[}\"\n}\n```", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Predict the difficulty level of the instance.

Start by carefully analyzing the original program and think of how an example would propagate through it from the input to the return value, considering how to modify the program in order to elicit a different behavior. Make sure that the return values or exceptions raised by your program are picklable.\nThe original program and your program will be used in a test to evaluate the skill of an expert computer scientist who will have to produce a diverging example (not necessarily the same as yours), so make sure that the difference you introduce are not very easy to understand. You will be given a difficulty level from 0 (easiest) to 10 (hardest) to target. E.g. difficulty level 0 means that an expert computer scientist in the bottom decile or above should be able to find a diverging example, difficulty level 9 means that only an expert computer scientist in the top decile should be able to find a diverging example, and difficulty level 10 means that only the top 1% or less of expert computer scientists should be able to find a diverging example.\nThink step by step before writing your program.

This will lead to different saturation values for certain inputs, particularly when the minimum value is significantly lower than the maximum value.\n\nThis change will produce diverging outputs for inputs where the minimum RGB value is much smaller than the maximum, affecting the saturation calculation.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef rgb_to_hsv(r, g, b):\n    r, g, b = r/255.0, g/255.0, b/255.0\n    mx = max(r, g, b)\n    mn = min(r, g, b)\n    df = mx - mn\n    if mx == mn:\n        h = 0\n    elif mx == r:\n        h = (60 * ((g - b) / df) + 360) % 360\n    elif mx == g:\n        h = (60 * ((b - r) / df) + 120) % 360\n    elif mx == b:\n        h = (60 * ((r - g) / df) + 240) % 360\n    if mn == 0:\n        s = 0\n    else:\n        s = (df / mn) * 100  # Changed from (df/mx) to (df/mn)\n    v = mx * 100\n    return h, s, v\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"r\": 255,\n  \"g\": 0,\n  \"b\": 0\n}\n```", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Predict the difficulty level of the instance.

Start by carefully analyzing the original program and think of how an example would propagate through it from the input to the return value, considering how to modify the program in order to elicit a different behavior. Make sure that the return values or exceptions raised by your program are picklable.\nThe original program and your program will be used in a test to evaluate the skill of an expert computer scientist who will have to produce a diverging example (not necessarily the same as yours), so make sure that the difference you introduce are not very easy to understand. You will be given a difficulty level from 0 (easiest) to 10 (hardest) to target. E.g. difficulty level 0 means that an expert computer scientist in the bottom decile or above should be able to find a diverging example, difficulty level 9 means that only an expert computer scientist in the top decile should be able to find a diverging example, and difficulty level 10 means that only the top 1% or less of expert computer scientists should be able to find a diverging example.\nThink step by step before writing your program.

Specifically, this change will cause the function to favor longer sequences in cases of mismatch, leading to a divergence in the output.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef super_seq(X, Y, m, n):\n    if (not m):\n        return n\n    if (not n):\n        return m\n    if (X[m - 1] == Y[n - 1]):\n        return 1 + super_seq(X, Y, m - 1, n - 1)\n    return 1 + max(super_seq(X, Y, m - 1, n), super_seq(X, Y, m, n - 1))\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"X\": \"abc\",\n  \"Y\": \"abdc\",\n  \"m\": 3,\n  \"n\": 4\n}\n```", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Predict the difficulty level of the instance.

This would create a divergence in behavior, as there would be cases where `list2` is a valid subset of `list1`, but the modified function would return `False` due to the length condition.\n\n### Diverging Behavior\n- If `list1` has more elements than `list2`, the modified function will return `False` even if all elements of `list2` are present in `list1`.\n- This will lead to diverging outputs for certain inputs.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef check_subset(list1, list2): \n    if len(list1) > len(list2):\n        return False\n    return all(map(list1.__contains__, list2))\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"list1\": [1, 2, 3, 4],\n  \"list2\": [2, 3]\n}\n```", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Predict the difficulty level of the instance.

Start by carefully analyzing the original program and think of how an example would propagate through it from the input to the return value, considering how to modify the program in order to elicit a different behavior. Make sure that the return values or exceptions raised by your program are picklable.\nThe original program and your program will be used in a test to evaluate the skill of an expert computer scientist who will have to produce a diverging example (not necessarily the same as yours), so make sure that the difference you introduce are not very easy to understand. You will be given a difficulty level from 0 (easiest) to 10 (hardest) to target. E.g. difficulty level 0 means that an expert computer scientist in the bottom decile or above should be able to find a diverging example, difficulty level 9 means that only an expert computer scientist in the top decile should be able to find a diverging example, and difficulty level 10 means that only the top 1% or less of expert computer scientists should be able to find a diverging example.\nThink step by step before writing your program.

It computes the result of raising `base` to the `power`, converts that result to a string, iterates over each character in the string, converts each character back to an integer, and then sums those integers. \n\nTo create a semantically different program, we need to modify the behavior of the function in such a way that it produces a different output for at least one input. One way to achieve this is to change how we handle the conversion of the power's result to a string and the subsequent summation of its digits.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. The original function sums the digits of the result of `base ** power`.\n2. We can introduce a condition that alters the summation process based on the value of `base` or `power`.\n3. Instead of summing all digits, we could sum only the even or odd digits, or we could introduce a transformation that changes the digits before summing them.\n\n### Diverging Behavior:\nFor example, if we modify the function to only sum the even digits of the result, we can create a scenario where the output diverges significantly from the original function. This will ensure that for certain inputs, the two functions will yield different results.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef power_base_sum(base, power):\n    result = str(pow(base, power))\n    return sum(int(i) for i in result if int(i) % 2 == 0)\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"base\": 2,\n  \"power\": 5\n}\n```", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Predict the difficulty level of the instance.

This will lead to a diverging output for certain inputs, especially when `n` has multiple prime factors.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef count_Fac(n):  \n    m = n \n    count = 0\n    i = 2\n    while((i * i) <= m): \n        total = 0\n        while (n % i == 0): \n            n /= i \n            total += 1 \n        temp = 0\n        j = 1\n        # Incorrect condition: changed from (temp + j) <= total to (temp + j) < total\n        while((temp + j) < total): \n            temp += j \n            count += 1\n            j += 1 \n        i += 1\n    if (n != 1): \n        count += 1 \n    return count \n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"n\": 12\n}\n```", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Predict the difficulty level of the instance.

The function uses a two-pointer approach to traverse both arrays and find the median elements.\n\n### Key Steps in the Original Function:\n1. **Initialization**: Two pointers `i` and `j` are initialized to 0, and `m1` and `m2` are initialized to -1. A counter `count` is set to 0.\n2. **While Loop**: The loop runs until `count` is less than `n + 1`. This ensures that the loop iterates exactly `n + 1` times to find the two middle elements for the median calculation.\n3. **Pointer Movement**: Inside the loop, the function checks if one of the arrays is exhausted. If `arr1` is exhausted, it assigns the first element of `arr2` to `m2` and vice versa. If both arrays have remaining elements, it compares the current elements pointed to by `i` and `j`, updating `m1` and `m2` accordingly and moving the appropriate pointer.\n4. **Median Calculation**: Finally, the median is calculated as the average of `m1` and `m2`.\n\n### Changes to Introduce Divergence:\nTo create a semantically different program, I will modify the logic to handle the case when one of the arrays is empty differently. Instead of directly assigning the first element of the non-exhausted array to `m2`, I will introduce a condition that may lead to an exception when trying to access an element from an empty array.

It uses a dynamic programming approach to build up a solution using a `sum` array that stores the maximum sums up to each index.\n\n1. **Initialization**: The function initializes a `sum` array to hold the maximum sums.\n2. **Base Cases**:\n   - If `n >= 1`, it sets `sum[0]` to `arr[0]`.\n   - If `n >= 2`, it sets `sum[1]` to the sum of the first two elements.\n   - If `n > 2`, it calculates `sum[2]` based on the maximum of the first three possible sums.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Loop**: For indices from 3 to `n-1`, it computes the maximum sum considering the current element and the previous sums.\n4. **Return Value**: Finally, it returns the maximum sum found at the last index of the `sum` array.\n\n### Key Observations\n- The function can handle arrays of different lengths, but it specifically focuses on the maximum sums involving three consecutive elements.\n- The logic in the loop for `i >= 3` is crucial as it determines how the sums are built up.\n\n### Diverging Behavior\nTo create a semantically different program, I will modify the logic in the dynamic programming loop.

The function does this by recursively checking the properties of the min-heap for each node in the binary tree represented by the array.\n\n### Key Points of the Original Function\n1. **Base Case**: The function first checks if the current index `i` has no children (i.e., `2 * i + 2 > len(arr)`). If true, it returns `True`, indicating that the subtree rooted at `i` is a valid min-heap.\n2. **Left Child Check**: It checks if the current node's value is less than or equal to its left child's value (if it exists) and recursively checks the left subtree.\n3. **Right Child Check**: It checks if the current node's value is less than or equal to its right child's value (if it exists) and recursively checks the right subtree.\n4. **Combining Results**: It combines the results of the left and right child checks to determine if the current subtree is a valid min-heap.\n\n### Modifications for Divergence\nTo create a semantically different program, we can alter the conditions under which the function evaluates the heap properties. For instance, we can introduce a scenario where we do not check the left child at all or modify the conditions for returning `True`. This would lead to different behavior when the input array has specific properties.\n\n### Example Divergence\nFor example, if the input array is `[3, 5, 4]`, the original function would return `False` because the min-heap property is violated at the root.

This change will lead to different outputs for inputs that contain '5' but do not start with it.\n\n### Potential Diverging Input\nAn example of a diverging input could be the string \"abc5def\". The original program would return `False` since it does not start with '5', while the modified program would return `True` because it contains '5'.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\nimport re\ndef match_num(string):\n    text = re.compile(r\"5\")\n    if text.search(string):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"string\": \"abc5def\"\n}\n```", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Predict the difficulty level of the instance.

It does the following:\n\n1. Initializes `m` to the value of `n`, `count` to 0, and `i` to 2 (the smallest prime).\n2. Enters a while loop that continues as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `m`. This loop iterates over potential prime factors.\n3. Inside the first loop, it initializes `total` to 0 and enters another while loop that divides `n` by `i` as long as `n` is divisible by `i`, counting the number of times this division occurs.\n4. It then initializes `temp` to 0 and `j` to 1, entering a third while loop that counts how many times you can add `j` to `temp` without exceeding `total`, incrementing `count` each time.\n5. After exiting the loops, if `n` is not equal to 1, it increments `count` by 1.\n6. Finally, it returns `count`.\n\nTo create a semantically different program, we can modify the logic of the inner loops or the conditions under which they operate.

Start by carefully analyzing the original program and think of how an example would propagate through it from the input to the return value, considering how to modify the program in order to elicit a different behavior. Make sure that the return values or exceptions raised by your program are picklable.\nThe original program and your program will be used in a test to evaluate the skill of an expert computer scientist who will have to produce a diverging example (not necessarily the same as yours), so make sure that the difference you introduce are not very easy to understand. You will be given a difficulty level from 0 (easiest) to 10 (hardest) to target. E.g. difficulty level 0 means that an expert computer scientist in the bottom decile or above should be able to find a diverging example, difficulty level 9 means that only an expert computer scientist in the top decile should be able to find a diverging example, and difficulty level 10 means that only the top 1% or less of expert computer scientists should be able to find a diverging example.\nThink step by step before writing your program.

It counts how many times `value` appears in `tuplex` using the `count` method of the tuple, which is a straightforward operation.\n\n### Key Characteristics of the Original Program\n1. **Input Types**: The function expects a tuple and a value. The tuple can contain any data type, and the value can be of any type that can be compared to the elements of the tuple.\n2. **Output**: The output is an integer representing the count of occurrences of `value` in `tuplex`.\n3. **Edge Cases**: If `tuplex` is empty, the count will be `0`. If `value` is not found, the count will also be `0`.\n\n### Potential Modifications\nTo create a semantically different program, I can introduce a behavior that changes how the counting is performed. For example, I could modify the program to count occurrences of `value` only if the elements in the tuple are of a specific type or meet a certain condition. This would lead to different outputs for inputs that contain the `value` but do not meet the condition.\n\n### Example Modification\n1. **Type Checking**: I can modify the function to count `value` only if the elements in `tuplex` are of type `int`. This means that if `tuplex` contains non-integer types, those occurrences will not be counted, even if they match `value`.\n\nThis modification introduces a condition that can lead to diverging behavior, especially when `tuplex` contains mixed types.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef count_tuplex(tuplex, value):  \n    count = sum(1 for x in tuplex if isinstance(x, int) and x == value)\n    return count\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"tuplex\": (1, 2, 3, \"3\", 3.0),\n  \"value\": 3\n}\n```", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Predict the difficulty level of the instance.

The function uses a dynamic programming approach, where it maintains an array `sum` to store the maximum sums up to each index.\n\n### Key Points in the Original Code\n1. **Initialization**: The `sum` array is initialized to store the maximum sums up to each index.\n2. **Base Cases**: The function handles the first three elements separately to avoid index errors.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Loop**: For indices greater than 2, it calculates the maximum sum by considering:\n   - The maximum sum up to the previous index.\n   - The sum of the current element and the maximum sum up to two indices before.\n   - The sum of the current and previous elements plus the maximum sum up to three indices before.\n\n### Potential Changes\nTo create a semantically different program, I can modify the logic in the dynamic programming loop. Specifically, I can introduce a condition that changes the way sums are calculated, such as ignoring certain elements based on their value or introducing an arbitrary threshold that alters the flow of the calculation.\n\n### Example Divergence\nBy introducing a condition that skips elements less than a certain threshold, the behavior of the function can change significantly.

The function uses a three-pointer approach to iterate through the arrays, adjusting the pointers based on the minimum and maximum values encountered.\n\n### Key Steps in the Original Function:\n1. **Initialization**: The function initializes variables to track the smallest difference found and the indices of the elements that produce this difference.\n2. **Three-Pointer Loop**: The while loop runs as long as there are elements left in all three arrays.\n   - It calculates the minimum and maximum of the current elements pointed to by the three pointers.\n   - If the difference between the maximum and minimum is smaller than the previously found difference, it updates the result indices.\n   - It increments the pointer of the array that contains the current minimum value to explore potentially smaller differences.\n3. **Early Exit**: If a difference of zero is found, the function exits early, as this is the best possible outcome.\n\n### Potential Changes:\nTo create a non-semantic equivalent, I can introduce a change that modifies the logic of how the pointers are incremented. For instance, I could add a condition that increments a pointer based on a different criterion, such as always incrementing the pointer of the maximum value instead of the minimum.

This will ensure that for certain inputs, the two programs will produce different results.\n\n### Key Changes\n- Introduce a condition that changes the counting mechanism based on the parity of `n`.\n- This will lead to different outputs for odd and even values of `n`, which is a subtle change that can lead to divergence.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef count_Set_Bits(n) :  \n    n += 1; \n    powerOf2 = 2;   \n    cnt = n // 2;  \n    while (powerOf2 <= n) : \n        totalPairs = n // powerOf2;  \n        if n % 2 == 0:  # If n is even\n            cnt += (totalPairs // 2) * powerOf2;  \n        else:  # If n is odd\n            cnt += (totalPairs // 2) * powerOf2 + (n % powerOf2)\n        powerOf2 <<= 1;    \n    return cnt;  \n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"n\": 5\n}\n```", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Predict the difficulty level of the instance.

This will lead to incorrect behavior for even non-perfect square numbers.\n\n# Generated program\n```python\ndef is_Perfect_Square(n):\n    i = 1\n    while (i * i <= n):\n        if (n % 2 == 0):  # Always returns True for even numbers\n            return True\n        if ((n % i == 0) and (n / i == i)):\n            return True     \n        i = i + 1\n    return False\n```\n\n# Diverging input example\n```python\n{\n  \"n\": 6\n}\n```", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Predict the difficulty level of the instance.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert computer scientist. Your task is to take a Python 3.10 program and write a similar program which is not semantically equivalent, which means that there must exist at least a diverging input example such that the original program and your program either produce different outputs or exceptions, or one halts and the other one does not halt. In addition to a program, you need to produce a diverging input example. Start by carefully analyzing the original program and think of how an example would propagate through it from the input to the return value, considering how to modify the program in order to elicit a different behavior. Make sure that the return values or exceptions raised by your program are picklable.\nThe original program and your program will be used in a test to evaluate the skill of an expert computer scientist who will have to produce a diverging example (not necessarily the same as yours), so make sure that the difference you introduce are not very easy to understand. You will be given a difficulty level from 0 (easiest) to 10 (hardest) to target. E.g. difficulty level 0 means that an expert computer scientist in the bottom decile or above should be able to find a diverging example, difficulty level 9 means that only an expert computer scientist in the top decile should be able to find a diverging example, and difficulty level 10 means that only the top 1% or less of expert computer scientists should be able to find a diverging example.\nThink step by step before writing your program.

Within this loop:\n   - It retrieves the current `first_ludic` value from the list.\n   - It calculates `remove_index` as the sum of `index` and `first_ludic`.\n   - A nested loop then removes elements from the `ludics` list starting from `remove_index`, incrementing `remove_index` by `first_ludic - 1` each time.\n\n4. **Return**: Finally, the function returns the modified `ludics` list.\n\n### Key Observations\n- The function modifies the `ludics` list by removing elements based on the values of the elements themselves.\n- The logic for removing elements is dependent on the current index and the value at that index.\n\n### Potential Changes\nTo create a semantically different version, we can:\n- Change the logic of the removal process to use a different condition or a different way of calculating the `remove_index`.\n- Introduce a modification that affects the loop behavior, such as altering the increment logic or the condition for the inner loop.\n\n### Proposed Changes\nI will modify the inner loop to remove elements based on a different logic that does not depend on the current `first_ludic` value.
